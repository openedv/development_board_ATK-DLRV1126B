# Documentation Directory Overview

In the Rockchip Linux SDK, the documentation is divided into directories for Chinese documents (cn), English documents (en), and license information (licenses). The licenses directory contains the following:

```
licenses/
├── BUILDROOT_README
├── LICENSE
├── host-manifest.csv
├── manifest.csv
└── pkg-stats.html
```

The LICENSE file is Rockchip's document licensing statement. The host-manifest.csv, manifest.csv, and BUILDROOT_README are detailed explanations of third-party package licenses compiled by default by the Buildroot system. pkg-stats.html is used by Buildroot to generate detailed information reports for all packages under the current configuration, as well as to detect known CVE vulnerabilities and upstream version update statuses.

The documentation released with the Rockchip Linux SDK is intended to help developers quickly get started with development and debugging. The content covered in the documentation does not encompass all development knowledge and issues. The list of documents will continue to be updated. If you have any questions or needs regarding the documentation, please contact our FAE support at fae@rock-chips.com.

In the Rockchip Linux SDK, the docs directory is divided into Chinese (cn) and English (en). The Chinese directory includes Common (general development guidance documents), Socs (chip platform-related documents), Linux (Linux system development-related documents), Others (other reference documents), and docs_list_en.txt (docs file directory structure). The specific introduction is as follows: (Note: The last sentence seems to be incomplete in the original text, so it is translated as provided.)

        <div style="background-color:#ffffff;">
        <img src="resources/framework.png" title="RKNN"/>
    </center>
In order to use RKNPU, users need to first run the RKNN-Toolkit2 tool on the computer, convert the trained model into an RKNN format model, and then inference on the development board using the RKNN C API or Python API.

#### RKNN-TOOLKIT2

RKNN-Toolkit2 is a software development kit for users to perform model conversion, inference and performance evaluation on PC and Rockchip NPU platforms.

RKNN-Toolkit-Lite2 provides Python programming interfaces for Rockchip NPU platform to help users deploy RKNN models and accelerate the implementation of AI applications.

The development kit is located in the `external/rknn-toolkit2` directory, mainly used to implement a series of functions such as model conversion, optimization, quantization, inference, performance evaluation, and accuracy analysis.

Basic functions are as follows:

| Function    | Description |
| :------------: | :----------- |
| Model Conversion | Supports floating-point models of Pytorch / TensorFlow / TFLite / ONNX / Caffe / Darknet<br/>Supports quantization-aware models (QAT) of Pytorch / TensorFlow / TFLite<br/>Supports dynamic input models (dynamicization/native dynamic)<br/>Supports large models |
| Model Optimization | Constant folding / OP correction / OP Fuse&Convert / Weight sparsification / Model pruning |
| Model Quantization | Supports quantization types: asymmetric i8/fp16 <br/>Supports Layer / Channel quantization methods; Normal / KL/ MMSE quantization algorithms<br/>Supports mixed quantization to balance performance and accuracy |
| Model Inference | Supports model inference through the simulator on the PC<br/>Supports model inference on the NPU hardware platform (board-level inference)<br/>Supports batch inference, supports multi-input models |
| Model Evaluation | Supports performance and memory evaluation of the model on the NPU hardware platform |

### Multimedia

The general process of video encoding and decoding on the Rockchip Linux platform:

```
vpu_service  -->  mpp --> gstreamer/rockit --> app
vpu_service: driver
MPP: A video encoding and decoding middleware for the Rockchip platform. Please refer to the MPP documentation for detailed instructions
Gstreamer/rockit: used to connect components such as apps
```

Currently, gstreamer is used in Debian/Buildroot systems by default to connect apps and codec components.

Currently, the key development documents are as follows:

```
docs/en/Linux/Multimedia/
├── Rockchip_Developer_Guide_Linux_RKADK_EN.pdf
├── Rockchip_User_Guide_Linux_Gstreamer_EN.pdf
└── Rockchip_User_Guide_Linux_Rockit_EN.pdf
```

 Encoding and decoding functionalities can also be tested directly through the testing interfaces provided by MPP (such as mpi_dec_test\mpi_enc_test...). MPP source code reference is located in `<SDK>/external/mpp/`. For testing demos, please refer to `<SDK>/external/mpp/test`. Please refer to  the SDK document `Rockchip_Developer_Guide_MPP_EN.pdf`  for details.

Rockchip chips like RK3588 support powerful multimedia capabilities:

- Supports H.265/H.264/AV1/VP9/AVS2 video decoding, up to 8K60FPS, also supports 1080P multi-format video decoding (H.263, MPEG1/2/4, VP8, JPEG).
- Supports 8K H.264/H.265 video encoding and 1080P VP8, JPEG video encoding.
- Video post-processing: deinterlacing, noise reduction, edge/detail/color optimization.

Below are the reference specifications for common chip encoding and decoding capabilities on each platform.

> **Note:** The maximum testing specifications are related to numerous factors, so the same decoding IP specifications might differ among different chips. Chip support may vary in different systems, leading to differences in supported formats and performance.
